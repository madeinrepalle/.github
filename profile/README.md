### *Farm-fresh seasonal fruits. Taste of the Indian soil and sunshine.*

## 🍎 About Us
**Made In Repalle** is our family farm initiative. We grow and sell high-quality hybrid fruits, specifically the **Bala Sundari (Apple Ber)**, right here in the fertile lands of Repalle, Andhra Pradesh.

Our goal is simple:
* **Support Local:** We farm with care and respect for the soil.
* **Connect:** We want to bring the taste of Repalle to people everywhere.
* **Quality:** We harvest at the perfect time so the fruit is sweet and crunchy.
